# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to develop machine learning model to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers using historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## Financial Information:

The dataset contained information about various financial attributes of borrowers, such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt, among others.

* The target variable, "loan_status," indicated whether a loan was healthy (0) or at high risk (1).

## Variables to Predict:

We aimed to predict the likelihood of loan default, which was represented by the "loan_status" variable. Based on the value_counts()

* There are 75,036 instances where the loan status is labeled as 0, indicating healthy loans.

* There are 2,500 instances where the loan status is labeled as 1, indicating high-risk loans.

## Machine Learning Process:

1. Data Preprocessing: This includes spliting the data into training and testing sets.

2. Model Selection: I have selected logistic regression as the initial model.

3. Model Training: The model was trained using the training dataset.

4. Evaluation: Evaluated the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision. 

## Methods Used: 

* Logistic Regression: This is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes from data. 

* Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.

* Model Evaluation Metrics: I used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. 

## Results 

Machine Learning Model 1

* Logistic Regression Model:
    1. Accuracy: 0.99
    2. Precision for label 0 (healthy loan): 1.00
    3. Precision for label 1 (high-risk loan): 084
    4. Recall for label 0: 0.99
    5. Recall for label 1: 0.94

## Summary

* The logistic regression model appears to perform the best overall, with an accuracy score of 0.99.

* It also demonstrates high precision scores for both label 0 (healthy loan) and label 1 (high-risk loan). It achieves a precision of 1.00 for label 0, which indicates when it predicts a loan as healthy, it is almost always correct.

* For label 1, while the precision is slightly lower at 0.84, it still indicates a relatively good ability to correctly identify high-risk loans.

Considering the high accuracy and precision scores achieved by the logistic regression model, it is recommended for use in predicting loan risk.
